Create a responsive and modern website called CharBit. The layout should be similar to Janitor AI, but this is not an AI chatbot platform. CharBit allows users to create and publish fictional characters, primarily for fun and self-expression, not for AI interaction or roleplaying. The character creation is focused entirely on attributes, personality, and profiles—not chat-based character interaction.

On the homepage, display a section for Featured Characters and Featured Artists, a search bar at the top, and a "Recently Viewed Characters" bar for logged-in users. Each character card shown should include a Like button, a visual preview or avatar, and be tagged with multiple user-defined tags, including a permanent tag named "OC" or "OCs". The site must support hundreds of tags to allow deep filtering and discovery.

Users must be able to sign up and log in using their email, set a username, and upload a custom profile picture. Each user should have a regular profile with privacy controls and a creator profile, which can be unlocked by applying through the site. Once someone becomes a creator, their creator profile is public indefinitely. Regular profiles allow users to display their created characters, their favorites, and the users or artists they follow.

Characters must include the following fields: Character Name, Character Nickname, Personality, About Character, and Tags. Each character should have a Favorite button, allowing logged-in users to add them to their favorites list. Favorited characters are accessible in a dedicated Favorites tab in the user’s profile, and they should be able to unfavorite at any time.

There should be three visibility settings per character:

Private: Only the creator can view

Restricted: Only friends can view

Public: Anyone can view

The site must support a Following system, where users can follow their favorite creators or users. When someone follows a user, they receive updates whenever that user posts or modifies a character. A section labeled "Characters From Artists You Follow" must be visible in the dashboard or homepage.

Users should also be able to friend each other. If two users are friends, they can chat with each other via a simple private messaging system. This feature is only available to mutual friends and must be restricted otherwise.

Include a Block system: If a user blocks another, neither party can view each other's profiles or characters until unblocked. This should be mutual and absolute—no character, profile, or content visibility in either direction.

The website should support multiple visual themes, and each logged-in user can switch themes at any time. The themes must include:

Black (default)

White

Midnight

Neon

Pinky

Bob (a galaxy-style aesthetic; the theme should simply be called “Bob”)

Users should be able to toggle themes live, and the choice should persist for logged-in users via backend preferences.

The overall layout should prioritize clean UI, responsive components, and modular front-end design using modern frameworks like React (optional, if supported). Character pages should look neat and descriptive, using cards or panels for each field (name, nickname, personality, etc.).

Finally, include a tag explorer system, so users can click on a tag (e.g., "OCs") and view all characters that share it. The system should support filtering by visibility, artist, or likes.
